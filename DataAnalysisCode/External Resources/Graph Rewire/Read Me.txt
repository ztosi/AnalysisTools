Most of this code is credit of Sergei Maslov and can be used to take a network and randomly rewire various connections. The resulting network will be random, but all nodes will have the same in and out degrees they had previously. I (Zach Tosi) modified his code to also preserve the number of bidirectional connections in the randomized network (dir_generate_srand_bid_prev.m).
