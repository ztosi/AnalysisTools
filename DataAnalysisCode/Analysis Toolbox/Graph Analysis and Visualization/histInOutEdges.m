%% Takes in a weight matrix (or adjacency matrix) and optionally a vector, then
% displays a surface plot where histograms for either the individual rows or columns
% of the matrix are displayed simultaneously. In more simple terms
% simultaneously displays histograms for each individual row or column of a
% matrix, using either the weight values in the matrix or the values in the
% supplied vector which are assumed to reflect some property of the nodes
% the graph represented by the matrix represents. Ignores zero-valued
% entries. EXAMPLE: Say the vector contains firing rates. This function
% will produce side by side histograms of the firing rates of the nodes
% which send connections to each node.
%
% DEPENDENTS:
%   
%   None.
%
% COMPATIBILITY: Not compatible with versions earlier than MATLAB 2014b
%
% EXAMPLE: histInOutEdges(wtMatix, varargin)
%
% INPUTS:
%       wtMatrix: A matrix represnting either a weight matrix (directed or
%       otherwise) or an adjacency matrix if a vector of node values are
%       supplied. An adjaceny matrix can be supplied without a vector, but
%       this will not produce a very interesting result... If a weighted
%       matrix is supplied without a vector then the resulting histograms
%       will reflected the weighted entries in each row or column. Bins 
%       applied to each row or column are created from the
%       Friedman-Diaconis rule applied to all nonzero entries in the
%       matrix.
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%       
%       (wtMat, 'Sort by', srtVec): In order for the many side by side
%       histograms to be intelligible it's advisable to order the nodes in
%       the network by some value. By default the sum of absolute weight
%       values in each row or column is used to order the nodes. Should
%       usually be the same as "useVec" if that is supplied, but this
%       doesn't have to be the case.
%       
%       (wtMat, 'Direction', dir): where dir is either 'incoming' or
%       'outgoing'. If 'incoming' then hisograms are derived from column
%       entries (or columns of the adjacency matrix element-wise multiplied
%       by the supplied vector) and if 'outgoing' then histograms are
%       derived from row entries. Thus the direction of the supplied weight
%       matrix is assumed to be: Entry at row i, column j represents the
%       edge FROM node i TO node j. DEFAULT: 'incoming'
%
%       (wtMat, 'Use', useVec): If this vector is supplied then the wtMat
%       is converted to an adjacency matrix if not already. Then depending
%       on "dir" will populate nonzero row or column entries using these
%       values. The result is that the values in useVec are assumed to be
%       values at each vertex and the resulting histograms display the
%       distribution of these values for each nodes that each node connects
%       to or receives connections from.
